    <center><h1>PV SINDHU</h1></center>
    <p><i>Pusarla Venkata Sindhu</i> is a sporting icon of the <mark>21st century</mark> and a shining beacon for sportswomen in India. The shuttler has risen to the top of the world in the last decade, winning dozens of titles across the globe.</p>
    <p>After becoming the first Indian woman to win a <b>silver medal</b> at the <mark>Olympics</mark> and <b>gold</b> at the <mark>BWF World Championships</mark>, PV Sindhu added another piece of metal to her glittering cabinet by winning her second straight Olympic medal - <mark>a bronze at Tokyo 2020</mark>, thus becoming the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals.</p>
    <p>PV Sindhu's consistency at the highest level can somewhat be attributed to the sporting genes she inherited from her parents. Born <mark>July 5, 1995</mark>, in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh to parents who were both volleyball players at the national level, sport already coursed through PV Sindhu's veins since she was born. While her parents may have been volleyball players, badminton caught PV Sindhu's fancy after watching Pullela Gopichand in action, and by the age of eight, she was a regular at the sport.</p>

Following her silver-medal win at the Rio Olympics, she was promoted to deputy sports manager. She was appointed as the first brand ambassador of <mark>Bridgestone India</mark>. She was appointed as the Deputy Collector (Group-I) by the Andhra Pradesh government in July 2017, which she took charge later in August.
