    <p>Sharma was born on April 30, 1987, in Bansod, Nagpur, in the state of Maharashtra, India. He first joined a cricket camp in <mark>1999</mark>, when coach Dinesh Lad, a friend of his uncle's, noticed his talent. Lad used to scout for talent in those days and was very impressed with the way Sharma bowled. Knowing that Sharma's uncle would not be able to afford the fees for the school where Lad was coach, Lad convinced the school's director to accept Sharma as a student and waive his entire fee so that he would have access to good training facilities. Sharma started off as a spinner before focusing on batting.</p>
    <p>Sharma made his senior-level debut in a List A game in 2006, scoring an unbeaten 31 for West Zone against Central Zone in the <b>Deodhar Trophy</b>. His run of scores in the tournament got him picked for the India A squad, and he made his first-class debut for India Athat team against <mark>New Zealand at Darwin later in 2006</mark>, scoring 57 and 22, respectively. India achieved a 3-wicket win over New Zealand. He subsequently made his <b>Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai</b>, one of the leading (and hard to break into) teams in the Indian domestic circuit, in the 2006-07 season and impressed with a double hundred while playing against Gujarat, as well as a half-century in a winning cause in the final that year. Sharma has gone on to represent Mumbai throughout his first-class career.</p>
